Place the land units alongside the transport in the sea zone. If the transport moves in the Noncombat Move phase,\n    any number of units aboard can offload into a single friendly territory.\n    Land units belonging to friendly powers must load on their controller\u2019s turn, be carried on your turn, and offload on a later\n    turn of their controller. This is true even if the transport remains in the same sea zone.\n    33\n    Whenever a transport offloads, it can\u2019t move again that turn. If a transport retreats, it can\u2019t offload that turn. A transport can\u2019t\n    offload in two territories during a single turn, nor can it offload cargo onto another transport. A transport can\u2019t load or offload\n    while in a hostile sea zone. Remember that hostile sea zones contain enemy units, but that for purposes of determining the\n    status of a sea zone, submarines and transports are ignored.\n    A transport can load and offload units without moving from the friendly sea zone it\u2019s in (this is known as \u201cbridging\u201d). Each such transport\n    is still limited to its cargo capacity. It can offload in only one territory, and once it offloads, it can\u2019t move, load, or offload again that turn.\n    Amphibious Assaults: A transport can take part in an amphibious assault step of the Conduct Combat phase. That is the only\n    time a transport can offload into a hostile territory.\n    During an amphibious assault, a transport must either offload al units that were loaded during the Combat Move phase or retreat during\n    sea combat. It can also offload any number of units owned by the transport\u2019s power that were already on board at the start of the turn.",img:"/images/transport.JPG",clicked:!1,type:"Sea, All"}],g=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(d.a)(a);function a(){var e;return Object(s.a)(this,a),(e=t.call(this)).onCardClick=function(t){var a=t.currentTarget.id-1,n=e.state.units,i=n[a];i.clicked=!i.clicked,n[a]=i,e.setState({units:n})},e.onCategorySelect=function(t){var a=t.currentTarget.id;e.setState({categoryField:a})},e.state={units:[],categoryField:"All"},e}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"componentDidMount",value:function(){this.setState({units:y})}},{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this.state,t=e.units,a=e.categoryField,n=t.filter((function(e){return e.type.toLowerCase().includes(a.toLowerCase())}));return t.length?Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"tc",children:[Object(h.jsx)("h1",{className:"f1-l f4 ma0",children:"Axis & Allies Units"}),Object(h.jsx)(p,{name:"All",buttonClick:this.onCategorySelect,isSelected:this.state.categoryField}),Object(h.jsx)(p,{name:"Land",buttonClick:this.onCategorySelect,isSelected:this.state.categoryField}),Object(h.jsx)(p,{name:"Air",buttonClick:this.onCategorySelect,isSelected:this.state.categoryField}),Object(h.jsx)(p,{name:"Sea",buttonClick:this.onCategorySelect,isSelected:this.state.categoryField}),Object(h.jsx)(p,{name:"Utility",buttonClick:this.onCategorySelect,isSelected:this.state.categoryField}),Object(h.jsx)(b,{children:Object(h.jsx)(f,{children:Object(h.jsx)(u,{cardClick:this.onCardClick,units:n})})})]}):Object(h.jsx)("h1",{children:"Loading..."})}}]),a}(n.Component);r.a.render(Object(h.jsx)(g,{}),document.getElementById("root")),o()}},[[16,1,2]]]);
