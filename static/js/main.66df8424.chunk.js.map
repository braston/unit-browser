A tank may not blitz through a territory that contains an enemy unit, even if the unit is an AAA (antiaircraft\n    artillery), industrial complex, air base, or naval base.\n    Combined Arms: Tanks can be combined with tactical bombers or mechanized infantry.\n    • Combining a tank and a tactical bomber increases the tactical bomber’s attack number from 3 to 4 (see “Tactical Bombers,”\n    page 29).\n    • Each mechanized infantry unit combined with a tank can blitz along with it (see “Mechanized Infantry,” page 26).`,\n    img: './images/tank.JPG',\n    clicked: false\n  },\n  {   \n    id: 9,\n    name: 'AAA (Antiaircraft Artillery)',\n    cost: '5',\n    attack: '-',\n    defense: '-',\n    move: '1 (noncombat only)',\n    characteristics: `Limited Move: Normally this unit can be moved only during the Noncombat Move phase. An AAA unit cannot move during\n    the Combat Move phase (other than being carried on a transport if the unit was loaded on a prior turn).\n    No Combat Value: Even though an AAA unit can defend, either alone or with other units, it has a combat value of 0. This\n    means that an AAA unit cannot fire in the defending units fire step. It can, however, be taken as a casualty. If a territory\n    containing AAA units and no combat units is attacked, the AAA units are automatically destroyed. AAA units may never\n    attack.\n    Air Defense: An AAA unit can fire at an air unit only when that unit attacks land and/or air units in the territory containing\n    that AAA unit. AAA units fire only once, before the first round of combat. Each AAA unit in the territory may fire up to 3\n    shots, but each attacking air unit may only be fired upon once. In other words, the total number of air defense dice rolled is 3\n    times the number of AAA units, or the number of attacking air units, whichever is the lesser. For example, 5 fighters attacking\n    a territory containing 2 AAA units would have 5 shots fired against them, while those same 5 fighters would have only 3 shots\n    fired against them if there were only 1 defending AAA unit.\n    Once the number of air defense dice is determined, the dice are rolled. For each “1” rolled, the attacker must choose 1 air unit\n    as a casualty. These casualties are removed immediately and will not participate in the remainder of the battle. This AAA fire\n    occurs immediately before normal combat occurs in the territory containing the AAA unit. AAA units do not defend facilities\n    against strategic or tactical bombing. Facilities have their own built-in air defenses (see “Industrial Complexes and Bases\n    (Facilities),” page 24).`,\n    img: './images/aaa.JPG',\n    clicked: false\n  },\n  {   \n    id: 10,\n    name: 'Fighters',\n    cost: '10',\n    attack: '3',\n    defense: '4',\n    move: '4',\n    characteristics: `Carrier Operations: Fighters can land on and take off from a carrier.

If a carrier survives a combat having taken 1 hit, it can be repaired by a visit to an\n    operative friendly naval base (see “Naval Bases,” page 25).\n    Carry Aircraft: An aircraft carrier can carry up to 2 air units, including those belonging to friendly powers (provided both powers\n    are at war). These air units may be of two types: fighters and tactical bombers. Air units on a friendly power’s carrier are always\n    treated as cargo on the carrier owner’s turn.\n    Carrier-based aircraft move independently of the carrier on their own turn. They move along with the carrier on its turn if they\n    belong to different powers. On the air units’ turn, they launch before the carrier moves, even if they are not leaving the sea zone\n    themselves. It’s possible for the carrier to make a combat movement while leaving its aircraft behind to make a noncombat\n    movement later.\n    During noncombat movement, fighters and tactical bombers may use their remaining movement to move into sea zones with\n    carriers in order to land on them. Carriers may also move, providing that they didn’t move during combat movement or participate\n    in combat. In fact, a carrier must move if it’s able, or remain in place, in order to provide a landing space for an air unit that would\n    not otherwise have one. Landing doesn’t actually occur until the Mobilize New Units phase, so air units and carriers must end their\n    movement in the same sea zone. Any air units that are not in an eligible landing space by the end of the Noncombat Move phase are\n    destroyed (note that this can include a sea zone in which a new carrier will be placed during the Mobilize New Units phase).\n    A damaged carrier can’t conduct air operations, which means that no air units may take off from or land on it. Any guest air units\n    31\n    that were on board the carrier as cargo at the time when it was damaged are trapped onboard and can’t leave, attack, or defend until\n    the carrier is repaired. Any air units that planned to land on the carrier must find another landing space by the end of noncombat\n    movement or be destroyed. (See “Phase 4: Noncombat Move,” page 21.)\n    Air Defense: Whenever an undamaged carrier is attacked, its aircraft (even those belonging to friendly powers) are considered\n    to be defending in the air and fight normally, even if only submarines are attacking and the air units cannot hit them because\n    there is no defending destroyer.\n    Air units based on a defending carrier must land on the same carrier if possible after the battle. If that carrier is destroyed\n    or damaged in combat, they must try to land on a different friendly carrier in the same sea zone, move 1 space to a friendly\n    carrier or territory, or be destroyed. This movement occurs during the Noncombat Move phase, before the acting player\n    makes any noncombat movements.\n    When a damaged carrier is attacked, any air units on board are considered cargo and can’t defend. If the carrier is lost, they\n    are lost along with it.`,\n    img: './images/carrier.JPG',\n    clicked: false\n  },\n  {   \n    id: 15,\n    name: 'Cruisers',\n    cost: '12',\n    attack: '3',\n    defense: '3',\n    move: '2',\n    characteristics: `Offshore Bombardment: Your cruisers (along with your battleships) can conduct offshore bombardment during an amphibious\n    assault (see “Amphibious Assaults—Step 2.

As a result, they have the capability of\n    cancelling many of the unit characteristics of enemy submarines.\n    A destroyer cancels the Treat Hostile Sea Zones as Friendly unit characteristic of any enemy submarine that moves into the\n    sea zone with it. This means that the submarine must immediately end its movement, whether combat or noncombat, upon\n    entering the sea zone. If a submarine ends its combat movement in a sea zone with an enemy destroyer, combat will result.\n    If a destroyer is in a battle, it cancels the following unit characteristics of all enemy submarines in that battle: Surprise Strike,\n    Submersible, and Can’t Be Hit by Air Units. Note that destroyers belonging to a power friendly to the attacker that happen to be in the\n    same sea zone as the battle don’t actually participate in it, therefore they don’t cancel any of these abilities of defending submarines.`,\n    img: './images/destroyer.JPG',\n    clicked: false\n  },\n  {   \n    id: 17,\n    name: 'Submarines',\n    cost: '6',\n    attack: '2',\n    defense: '1',\n    move: '2',\n    characteristics: `Submarines have several unit characteristics. Most of them are cancelled by the presence of an enemy destroyer.\n    Surprise Strike: Both attacking and defending submarines can make a Surprise Strike by firing before any other units fire in\n    a sea battle. As detailed in step 2 of the General Combat sequence (page 18), submarines make their rolls before any other\n    units, unless an enemy destroyer is present. If neither side was eligible for a Surprise Strike, there is no step 2. Players move\n    directly to step 3 of the General Combat sequence.\n    32\n    Submersible: A submarine has the option of submerging. It can do this anytime it would otherwise make a Surprise Strike.\n    The decision is made before any dice are rolled by either side (the attacker decides first) and takes effect immediately. When a\n    submarine submerges, it’s immediately removed from the battle strip and placed back on the map. As a result, it can no longer\n    fire or take hits in that combat. However, a submarine can’t submerge if an enemy destroyer is present in the battle.\n    On Station: Each submarine in a convoy sea zone is considered to be “On Station.” As such, it’s spending more time in the\n    sea zone and is more focused on locating and destroying convoys. While “On Station,” each submarine rolls 2 dice when\n    disrupting a convoy (see “Conduct Convoy Disruptions,” page 22).\n    Treat Hostile Sea Zones as Friendly: A submarine can move through a sea zone that contains enemy units, either in combat or\n    noncombat movement. However, if a submarine enters a sea zone containing an enemy destroyer, it must end its movement\n    there. If it ends its combat move in a hostile sea zone, combat will occur.\n    Doesn’t Block Enemy Movement: The “stealth” ability of submarines also allows enemy ships to ignore their presence.\n    Any sea zone that contains only enemy submarines doesn’t stop the movement of a sea unit. Sea units ending their combat\n    movement in a sea zone containing only enemy submarines may choose to attack them or not. Sea units can also end their\n    noncombat movement in a sea zone containing only enemy submarines.\n    Can’t Hit Air Units: When attacking or defending, submarines can’t hit air units.\n    Can’t Be Hit by Air Units: When attacking or defending, hits scored by air units can’t be assigned to submarines unless there\n    is a destroyer that is friendly to the air units in the battle.`,\n    img: './images/sub.JPG',\n    clicked: false\n  },\n  {   \n    id: 18,\n    name: 'Transports',\n    cost: '7',\n    attack: '0',\n    defense: '0',\n    move: '2',\n    characteristics: `No Combat Value: Even though a transport can attack or defend, either alone or with other units, it has a combat value of\n    0. This means that a transport can’t fire in the attacking units’ or the defending units’ fire steps. Transports may not attack\n    without being accompanied by at least 1 unit with an attack value, unless they are conducting an amphibious assault from a\n    friendly sea zone that is free of enemy submarines.\n    Doesn’t Block Enemy Movement: Any sea zone that contains only enemy transports doesn’t stop the movement of a sea\n    unit. Air or sea units with an attack value ending their combat movement in a sea zone containing only enemy transports\n    automatically destroy those transports (unless they are ignoring them to support an amphibious assault instead). This counts\n    as a sea combat for those sea units. Sea units can also end their noncombat movement in a sea zone containing only enemy\n    transports, in which case there would be no combat.\n    Chosen Last: Transports can be chosen as casualties only if there are no other eligible units. Normally this will occur when\n    only transports are left, but it can also occur under other circumstances. For example, air units attacking transports and\n    submarines will hit the transports because they can’t hit the submarines without a friendly destroyer present.\n    Carry Land Units: A transport can carry land units belonging to you or to friendly powers (provided both powers are at war).\n    Its capacity is any 1 land unit, plus 1 additional infantry. Thus, a full transport may carry 2 infantry or 1 tank, mechanized\n    infantry, artillery, or AAA unit plus 1 infantry. A transport can’t carry an industrial complex, an air base, or a naval base. Land\n    units on a transport are cargo; they can’t attack or defend while at sea and are destroyed if their transport is destroyed.\n    Loading and Offloading: A transport can load cargo in friendly sea zones before, during, and after it moves. A transport can pick\n    up cargo, move 1 sea zone, pick up more cargo, move 1 more sea zone, and offload the cargo at the end of its movement. It can also\n    remain at sea with the cargo still aboard (but only if the cargo remaining aboard was loaded in a previous turn, was loaded this turn\n    in the Noncombat Move phase, or was loaded this turn for an amphibious assault from which the transport retreated).\n    Loading onto and/or offloading from a transport counts as a land unit’s entire move; it can’t move before loading or after\n    offloading. Place the land units alongside the transport in the sea zone. If the transport moves in the Noncombat Move phase,\n    any number of units aboard can offload into a single friendly territory.\n    Land units belonging to friendly powers must load on their controller’s turn, be carried on your turn, and offload on a later\n    turn of their controller. This is true even if the transport remains in the same sea zone.\n    33\n    Whenever a transport offloads, it can’t move again that turn. If a transport retreats, it can’t offload that turn. A transport can’t\n    offload in two territories during a single turn, nor can it offload cargo onto another transport. A transport can’t load or offload\n    while in a hostile sea zone. Remember that hostile sea zones contain enemy units, but that for purposes of determining the\n    status of a sea zone, submarines and transports are ignored.\n    A transport can load and offload units without moving from the friendly sea zone it’s in (this is known as “bridging”). Each such transport\n    is still limited to its cargo capacity. It can offload in only one territory, and once it offloads, it can’t move, load, or offload again that turn.\n    Amphibious Assaults: A transport can take part in an amphibious assault step of the Conduct Combat phase. That is the only\n    time a transport can offload into a hostile territory.\n    During an amphibious assault, a transport must either offload al units that were loaded during the Combat Move phase or retreat during\n    sea combat. It can also offload any number of units owned by the transport’s power that were already on board at the start of the turn.`,\n    img: './images/transport.JPG',\n    clicked: false\n  },\n];\n","import React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport 'tachyons';\r\nimport SearchBox from '../components/SearchBox';\r\nimport CardList from '../components/CardList';\r\nimport './App.css';\r\nimport Scroll from '../components/Scroll';\r\nimport ErrorBoundry from '../components/ErrorBoundry';\r\nimport  { units } from '../units';\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        super();\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            units: [],\r\n            searchField: '',    \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    componentDidMount() {\r\n            this.setState({units: units});\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    onSearchChange = (event) => {\r\n        this.setState ({\r\n           searchField: event.target.value,\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    onCardClick = (event) => {\r\n        //Use currentTarget instead of target-\r\n        //target is what was clicked, currentTarget is what the event was bound to\r\n        console.log(event.currentTarget.id);\r\n        let modId = event.currentTarget.id -1;\r\n        let updatedUnits = this.state.units;\r\n        let updatedUnit = updatedUnits[modId];\r\n        console.log(updatedUnit);\r\n        updatedUnit.clicked = !updatedUnit.clicked;\r\n        updatedUnits[modId] = updatedUnit;\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            units: updatedUnits\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        const { units, searchField } = this.state;\r\n        const filteredunits = units.filter(robot => {\r\n            return robot.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchField.toLowerCase());\r\n        })\r\n\r\n      return !units.length ?\r\n            <h1>Loading...</h1> : (\r\n                <div className='tc'>\r\n                    <h1 className=\"f1\">Axis & Allies Units</h1>\r\n                    < SearchBox searchChange={this.onSearchChange}/>\r\n                    < Scroll>\r\n                        < ErrorBoundry >\r\n                            < CardList cardClick={this.onCardClick} units={filteredunits} />\r\n                        </ErrorBoundry>\r\n                    </Scroll>\r\n                </div>    \r\n            )\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default App;","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport App from './containers/App';\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n< App />\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
